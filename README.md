## How it works?

Are you frustrated with how difficult it is to experience new stuff online? This might be the answer.

Here is how it works:

- Finds a random Wikipedia page via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random;
- Based on the title it does a search in YouTube;
- Grabs the first video result;
- Profit!

If you leave it open, you will continue to experience new content as it goes.
